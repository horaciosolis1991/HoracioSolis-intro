Hi! My name is Horacio and i am 30 years old. I am an electronic engineer (civil)  very curious about the tech area, i really love to learn new stuffs specially in my 
area which is data. I have been working for more than 3 years with financial companies, helping them in several data aspects such as data wrangling, tasks and report
automation and data analysis. Also i have been working with Git and GitHub for more than a year, a proof of that is this repo that you are seeing.
In this repo you will find shareable information about some of my personal projects that i have developed, content related to the financial companies that i have worked
for is not allowed but some of the projects that you will find in this repo are base for some of the projects i have done for my clients.
